# Gradle Degraph Plugin [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/obecker/gradle-degraph.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/obecker/gradle-degraph)

This plugin adds a verification task to the build that executes [Degraph](https://github.com/schauder/degraph) 
dependency checks on the sources of the gradle project.
It will detect package cycles without any additional configuration. 
Using custom configuration settings you can define which package dependencies are allowed and which should be rejected. 

The latest version uses Degraph 0.1.4

---

**Important note**: the development on this project has stopped, mainly because Degraph isn't actively maintained any longer.
I have started a new project **[Decycle](https://github.com/obecker/decycle)** (written in Java), that detects cycles,
displays them as HTML, but removes the output for yed. It supports Java â‰¥ 11 and provides both a Gradle and a Maven plugin.

---

## Installation

The plugin has been released on the [Gradle Plugin Repository](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/de.obqo.gradle.degraph).
The latest version is 0.1.4.1 and requires at least Gradle version 4.1.

To use the plugin in your own project just add the following to your `build.gradle`:
```
plugins {
  id "de.obqo.gradle.degraph" version "0.1.4.1"
}
```

## Running

The plugin creates for each source set a corresponding <code>degraph<i>SourceSetName</i></code> task. 
Additionally there is one `degraph` task that runs all these source set specific tasks. 

You can run a single degraph check (for example for the `main` source set) with

```
gradle degraphMain
```

You can run all degraph checks with

```
gradle degraph
```

The `degraph` task has a dependency on the `check` task, so it will be executed together with other verification tasks if you run

```
gradle check
```

The result of each source set specific degraph task will be written to a corresponding file <code>$buildDir/reports/degraph/<i>name</i>.graphml</code> 
(where <i>name</i> is the name of the source set) in the
[GraphML format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphML).

## Configuration

The plugin adds a `degraph` configuration object to the build, that offers corresponding settings to those described in
the [Degraph Manual](http://blog.schauderhaft.de/degraph/documentation.html) (see in particular the [Testing](http://blog.schauderhaft.de/degraph/documentation.html#testing-of-dependencies)) section.

All configuration settings are optional.

<pre>
<b>degraph</b> {
    <b>toolVersion</b> '0.1.4'
    <b>sourceSets</b> sourceSets.main, sourceSets.test, ...
    <b>including</b> 'org.example.includes.**', ...
    <b>excluding</b> 'org.example.excludes.**', ...
    <b>slicings</b> {
        <i>name1</i> {
            <b>patterns</b> 'org.example.(*).**', ...
            <b>allow</b> 'a', 'b', ...
            <b>allowDirect</b> 'x', 'y', ...
        }
        <i>name2</i> {
            ...
        }
    }
}
</pre>

(_Note_: technically all configuration settings are method calls and no property assignments. 
So you have to use `toolVersion ...` or even `toolVersion(...)` instead of `toolVersion = ...`)

* `toolVersion`
  defines the version of degraph to be used. The default value is `'0.1.4'`
  (Note: newer versions of degraph have to be API compatible with version 0.1.4 for this to work)
* `sourceSets`
  defines the source sets that should be analyzed. 
  By default all source sets defined in the gradle build file are considered.
  That means this option is most useful if you only want a subset of the source sets to be checked.

* `including`
  defines ant style string patterns for the classes that should be included (default: all) 

* `excluding`
  defines ant style string patterns for the classes that should be excluded (default: none)

* `slicings`
  starts the slicings block, each [slicing](http://blog.schauderhaft.de/degraph/documentation.html#adding-slicings) 
  is defined by its name (also known as slicing type). A slicing configuration contains:
  * `patterns`
     a list containing unnamed patterns (String) or named patterns. 
     A named pattern is defined using <code>namedPattern(<i>name</i>, <i>pattern</i>)</code>.<br>
     _Note_: in a named pattern the name comes first, like in the Scala Constraint DSL, but unlike in the Java Constraint DSL 
  * `allow`
    defines a [simple constraint](http://blog.schauderhaft.de/degraph/documentation.html#simple-constraints-on-slicings) on the defined slices
  * `allowDirect`
    defines a [strict constraint](http://blog.schauderhaft.de/degraph/documentation.html#strict-constraints) on the defined slices. As constraints (both simple and strict) you can use
    * a string (referencing the name of the pattern/slice)
    * <code>anyOf(<i>slice, ...</i>)</code>, see [Unspecified order of slices](http://blog.schauderhaft.de/degraph/documentation.html#unspecified-order-of-slices)
    * <code>oneOf(<i>slice, ...</i>)</code>, see [One of many slices](http://blog.schauderhaft.de/degraph/documentation.html#one-of-many-slices)

* _Note_: there is no `noJars` option. 
  The `degraph` task will use only the outputs of the given source sets, which don't include jars by default.

## Examples

Here are some examples from the degraph manual and their corresponding gradle configuration:

Slicing configuration in the Scala Constraint DSL:
```scala
classpath.including("de.schauderhaft.**") //
    .withSlicing("module", "de.schauderhaft.(*).**") // use the third part of the package name as the module name
    .withSlicing("layer", 
        ("persistence","de.schauderhaft.legacy.db.**"), // consider everything in the package de.schauderhaft.legacy.db and subpackages as as part of the layer "persistence"
        "de.schauderhaft.*.(*).**") // for everything else use the fourth part of the package name as 
    ) 
```
Gradle:
```groovy
degraph {
    including 'de.schauderhaft.**'
    slicings {
        module {
            patterns 'de.schauderhaft.(*).**'
        }
        layer {
            patterns(namedPattern('persistence', 'de.schauderhaft.legacy.db.**'), 
                     'de.schauderhaft.*.(*).**')
        }
    }
}
```

Slice constraints in the Scala Constraint DSL:
```scala
classpath
    .withSlicing("module", "de.schauderhaft.degraph.(*).**")
        .allow("check", anyOf("configuration", "graph"), "model")
```
Gradle:
```groovy
degraph {
    slicings {
        module {
            patterns 'de.schauderhaft.degraph.(*).**'
            allow 'check', anyOf('configuration', 'graph'), 'model'
        }
    }
}
```

## Building

After cloning this repository you can build and deploy a version of the gradle degraph plugin to your local maven repository by running

```
gradlew build publishToMavenLocal
```

Then add the following configuration to your project's `build.gradle`:
```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        mavenLocal()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'de.obqo.gradle:gradle-degraph:0.1.4.1'
    }
}

apply plugin: 'de.obqo.gradle.degraph'
```
